abstract = "A simple model for uncontrolled rectifiers with capacitive filter working in discontinuous current mode is developed in this paper. The presented model allows the rectifier ac line current harmonics to be obtained in an easy way. Previously, both the width and the peak value of the ac current pulse are calculated by means of analytical equations. This model is obtained when the rectifier working point is defined by dc current consumption or dc power consumption. In the first case, the expressions of the width and peak value are analytical, whereas in the second case they are non-linear; thus, an iterative algorithm is proposed to solve them. The rectifier behaviour is also graphically characterised in both cases from the previous equations normalisation. Several examples of the proposed model application are presented. Lastly, it is exposed that the model allows harmonic current emission to be studied in an easy, friendly way, according to the present regulations for both rectifiers."

It is shown that the differential drive rectifier can be configured as the differential CMOS LC-oscillator by swapping input and output terminals. Thus, this oscillator can then be used to find the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) component values for the rectifier matching network at the intended frequency, which is the oscillation frequency of the oscillator. Measured results show that the absolute frequency error between resonant frequency obtained from oscillator mode and matching frequency obtained as rectifier is less than 2\%. The switching core used in this work has been implemented in a standard 0.18μm CMOS technology and external discrete passive components are used to form the LC network.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present the use of symbolic regression for the black-box modelling of non-linear dynamic behaviour in the AC/DC rectifiers of radio-frequency identification (RFID) circuits. Typical simulations of an AC/DC rectifier are exceptionally slow when performed using conventional transistor-level simulations. The proposed modelling strategy is capable of modelling the transient process, i.e., the change in the output voltage as a function of time, both accurately and efficiently. The accuracy and the simulation speed are compared to the transistor-level simulations. The results show that the symbolic regression models are accurate and several orders of magnitude faster than the transistor-level models. The proposed strategy is demonstrated for rectifiers designed using 130-nm, 180-nm and 0.35-μm CMOS process. The simulation speed-up factor of the proposed model is shown to be between 1080 and 3.84E6 times for a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 4.8mV.},

  abstract = {In trying to reach the goal of controlling the environment, recent years have seen the rapid emergence of Wireless Sensors Networks (WSN). Nevertheless, the lifetime of sensor nodes shows a strong dependence on battery capacity. Recently energy harvesting techniques have been considered to allow the use of WSN in the ``deploy and forget'' mode. This paper proposes an assessment of the performance of a WSN enslaved to an optimized Radiofrequency Energy Harvesting System (REHS). The energy budget of a sensor node in a Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol is quantified and used to evaluate the performance of the WSN.},

Use of the PIFA in the tag design reduces problems when the tag operates near ground and metal structures which often occur in a variety of applications. Vector network analyzer measurements as well as indoor measurements have been performed to demonstrate that harvester performance near metal structures is not degraded in contrast to systems equipped with dipole antennas. It has been found that the microcontroller could be powered up to a 3m range for time intervals up to 20ms while standing as near as 1cm above a metal plane.},
